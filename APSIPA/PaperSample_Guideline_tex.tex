\begin{abstract}
  In the field of machine learning, deep learning is widely used to 
improve versatility and accuracy by deepening the network. Deep learning 
can achieve higher expression ability compared to conventional models 
but requires large amounts of data and time for training. To tackle this 
issue, we propose a training data reduction method using support vectors 
(SVs) that are closest data to the classification boundary obtained by 
Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this research, we use the training data 
consisting of support vectors to training neural networks and evaluate 
the effect. In the evaluation experiment, we confirmed that it is 
possible to reduce the number of training data by about 12\% and reduce 
the learning time of neural network by about 9.5\% by using ResNet, a 
model of deep learning, and the CIFAR-10 data set.

top = 19mm, bottom = 43mm and left = right = 13mm.  The column width
is 8mm (3.45 in).  The space between the two columns is 4mm (0.17 in).
Paragraph indentation is 3.5 mm (0.14 in).

% top = 0.75 inches, bottom = 1 inch and left = right = 0.625 inches.
% The column width is 3.5 inches.  The space between the two columns
% is 0.25 inches.  %Paragraph indentation is 3.5 mm (0.14 in).

\subsection{Style}
The style of the paper is single-spaced two-column format like this
sample.  Left- and right-justify your columns.  Use tables and figures
to adjust column length.  On the last page of your paper, adjust the
lengths of the columns so that they are equal.  Use automatic
hyphenation and check spelling.  Digitize or paste down figures.

\subsection{The First Page}
Center the title across both columns at the top of the first page,
followed by authors' names and their affiliations.  Long title should
be typed on two lines without a blank line intervening.

The two-column format should start with the abstract.  Type the
abstract at the beginning of the left column in the first page,
leaving approximately 1 cm (0.39 in) from the title part.  The
abstract should be the same as that submitted electronically on the
symposium website.

Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after the abstract,
observing the two-column format as shown in this example.


\section{Helpful Hints}
\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Position figures and tables at the tops and bottoms of columns near
where they are first discussed.  Avoid placing them in the middle of
columns or at the end of the paper.  Large figures and tables may span
across both columns.

Figure captions should be centered below the figures; table captions
should be centered above.  Avoid placing figures and tables before
their first mention in the text.  Use the abbreviation ``Fig. 1,''
even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=70mm]{Fig1-Times-Roman.eps}
%\includegraphics[width=70mm]{Fig1-TimesNewRomanPSMT.eps}
%\fbox{ \rule[-17mm]{0pt}{30mm} FIGURE }
\end{center}
\caption{Magnetization as a function of applied field.}
\vspace*{-3pt}
{\hfill\footnotesize Note how the caption is centered in the column.\hfill}
\end{figure}

Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather
than symbols.  For example, write ``Magnetization,'' or
``Magnetization (M)'' not just ``M.''  Put units in parentheses.  Do
not label axes only with units.  In the example, write ``Magnetization
(A/m)'' or ``Magnetization (A $\cdot$ m$^{-1}$).''  Do not label axes
with a ratio of quantities and units.  For example, write
``Temperature (K),'' not ``Temperature/K.''

Multipliers can be especially confusing.  Write ``Magnetization
(kA/m)'' or ``Magnetization ($10^3$ A/m).''  Figure labels should be
legible, about 10-point type.

\subsection{References}
Number citations consecutively in square brackets [1].  Punctuation
follows the bracket [2]. Refer simply to the reference number, as in
[3]. Use ``Ref. [3]'' or ``Reference [3]'' at the beginning of a
sentence: ``Reference [3] was the first ...''


Gather the full set of references together in the section of
references.  Place the section of references before any appendices,
unless they contain references.  Arrange the references in
alphabetical order or in order of appearance in the paper.

Give all authors' names; use ``et al.''  if there are six authors or
more.  Papers that have not been published, even if they have been
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' [4].
Papers that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in
press'' [5].  In a paper title, capitalize the first word and all
other words except for conjunctions, prepositions less than seven
letters, and prepositional phrases.

For papers published in translated journals, first give the English
citation, then the original foreign-language citation [6].

\subsection{Appendices}
Although conference papers do not normally have an appendix,
appendices, if any, directly follow the text and the references, (but
see IV.B).  Letter them in sequence and provide an informative title:
{\bf Appendix A Title of Appendix}.

\subsection{Footnote}
Number footnotes separately in superscripts like this\footnote{This is
  how a footnote should appear.}.  Place the actual footnote at the
bottom of the column in which it was cited.  Footnotes should be
separated from the text by a line\footnote{Note the line separating
  the footnotes from the text.}.  Do not put footnotes in the
reference list.  Use letters for table footnotes (see Table I).


\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}

Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the
text, even if they have been defined in the abstract.  Abbreviations
such as APSIPA, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined.
Do not use abbreviations in the title unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Equations}

Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in parentheses
flush with the right margin, as in (1).  To make your equations more
compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or
appropriate exponents.  Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and
variables, but not Greek symbols.  Use an en dash ( $-$ ) rather than
a hyphen for a minus sign.  Use parentheses to avoid ambiguities in
denominators.  Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they
are part of a sentence, as in

\begin{equation}
 a + b = c.
\end{equation}

Symbols in your equation should be defined before the equation appears
or immediately following.  Use ``(1),'' not ``Eq. (1)'' or ``equation
(1),'' except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation (1) is ...''

\subsection{Other Recommendations}

The Roman numerals used to number the section headings are optional.
If you do use them, do not number {\scshape{Acknowledgment}} and
{\scshape{References}}, and begin Subheadings with letters.

Use two spaces after periods (full stops).  Hyphenate complex
modifiers: ``zero-field-cooled magnetization.''  Avoid dangling
participles, such as, ``Using (1), the potential was calculated.''
Write instead, ``The potential was calculated using (1),'' or ``Using
(1), we calculated the potential.''


\renewcommand{\textheight}{98mm}


Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25,'' not ``.25.''  Use
``cm$^3$,'' not ``cc.''  Do not mix complete spellings and
abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m$^2$'' or ``webers per square meter,''
not ``webers/m$^2$.''  Spell units when they appear in text: ``...a
few henries,'' not ``...a few H.''  If your native language is not
English, try to get a native English-speaking colleague to proofread
your paper.  Do not add page numbers.

%\newpage
\section{Units}

Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are
encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in
parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as
identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive.''

Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and
magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because
equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units,
clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.

\section{Some Common Mistakes}

The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.  The subscript for the
permeability of vacuum$_0$ is zero, not a lowercase letter ``o.''  In
American English, periods and commas are within quotation marks,
``like this period.''  A parenthetical statement at the end of a
sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this).
(A parenthetical \emph{sentence} is punctuated within the
parentheses.)  A graph within a graph is an ``inset,'' not an
``insert.''  The word alternatively is preferred to the word
``alternately'' (unless you mean something that alternates).  Do not
use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or
``effectively.''  Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones
``affect'' and ``effect,'' ``complement'' and ``compliment,''
``discreet'' and ``discrete,'' ``principal'' and ``principle.''  Do
not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer.''  The prefix ``non'' is not a
word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a
hyphen.  There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation
``et al.''  The abbreviation ``i.e.''  means ``that is,'' and the
abbreviation ``e.g.''  means ``for example.''  An excellent style
manual for science writers is [7].


\section{Conclusions}
The conclusion goes here.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is
without an ``e'' after the ``g.''  Try to avoid the stilted
expression, ``One of us (R. B. G.) thanks ...'' Instead, try
``R.B.G. thanks ...''  Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered
footnote on the first page.
