In this study, we tried to reduce training data in deep learning by using support vectors. Although several existing studies used data reduction by support vectors, the difference from them is that support vectors are applied to CIFAR-10. First, we conducted preliminary experiments to reduce training data using support vectors for six types of two-dimensional data, and it was confirmed that training data could be reduced by 86 to 88\% while maintaining the accuracy. Based on this, when trying to reduce training data using support vectors for the problem of classifying CIFAR-10 color images as well, The training data could be reduced by about 12\% in the 5-class classification and about 5\% in the 10-class classification with almost no deterioration in accuracy. Although the effect was not obtained like the result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the training data could be reduced by using the support vector for CIFAR-10 as well.
